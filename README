Mediathread
===========================================================

Mediathread is a Django site for multimedia annotations facilitating
collaboration on video and image analysis. Developed at the Columbia
Center for New Media Teaching and Learning (CCNMTL)

CODE: http://github.com/ccnmtl/mediathread (see wiki for some dev documentation)
INFO: http://ccnmtl.columbia.edu/mediathread
FORUM: http://groups.google.com/group/mediathread

REQUIREMENTS
------------
Python 2.6 (or 2.5)
Postgres (or MySQL)

In Ubuntu (for postgres 8.4, but just change version numbers):
$ sudo aptitude install postgres-8.4 postgresql-client-8.4 postgresql-server-dev-8.4 python-psycopg2 gcc python2.6 python-dev libc6-dev 


INSTALLATION
------------

1. Mediathread relies on several submodules.  The easiest way to download
   it all is to run with git 1.6.5+ is:

  git clone --recursive https://github.com/ccnmtl/mediathread.git 

2. Build the database
   For Postgres:
     A. Create the database ($ createdb mediathread)

   For MySQL:
     A. Edit the file requirements/libs.txt
        - comment out the line 'psycopg2'
        - uncomment 'MySQLdb'
     B. Create the database ($ echo "CREATE DATABASE mediathread" | mysql -uroot -p mysql)

   For Both:
     Edit the lines in settings_shared.py that start with DATABASE_ as appropriate
     Even better would be:
       $ mkdir deploy_specific
       $ touch deploy_specific/__init__.py
       # edit a file called deploy_specific/settings.py setting those same variables
         which will override the values in settings_shared.py
         This is where we add custom settings for our deployment that will not
         be included in the open-sourced distribution



3. Bootstrap uses virtualenv to build a contained library in ve/
  ./bootstrap.py
  NOTE: if you're using python2.5 use ./bootstrap-python25.py instead

# It has been a little while since I installed mediathread, but according to my notes I had also to install
# the wsgiref package, which did not seem to be included -- so I did the following

[root@mediathread wsgiref-0.1.2]# pwd
/root
[root@mediathread ~]# wget http://pypi.python.org/packages/source/w/wsgiref/wsgiref-0.1.2.zip#md5=29b146e6ebd0f9fb119fe321f7bcf6cb
 
[root@mediathread ~]# unzip wsgiref-0.1.2.zip 
 
[root@mediathread ~]# cd wsgiref-0.1.2
 
[root@mediathread wsgiref-0.1.2]# python setup.py install

According to my notes, I had to uncomment a line from settings_shared.py -- my notes say: uncommented 'sites' application from settings_shared.py, since I know it causes database errors if it's missing when the db is built
 
[root@mediathread mediathread]# pwd
/var/www/mediathread/mediathread
[root@mediathread mediathread]# vi settings_shared.py 
 
INSTALLED_APPS = (
    'django.contrib.auth',
    'django.contrib.contenttypes',
    'django.contrib.sessions',
    #'django.contrib.sites',
 
INSTALLED_APPS = (
    'django.contrib.auth',

    'django.contrib.sites',


# GT comment 3
We're using mysql and saw an error related to this when running bootstrap.py:

Failed to install index for threadedcomments.ThreadedComment model: (1170, "BLOB/TEXT column 'tree_path' used in key specification without a key length")
 
More discussion here:
 
https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/2495
http://drupal.org/node/146296
 
But it appears that syncdb adjusted things so that the index on tree_path uses a limit of 255:
 
mysql> show create table threadedcomments_comment;
 
( `comment_ptr_id` int(11) NOT NULL,
  `title` longtext NOT NULL,
  `parent_id` int(11) DEFAULT NULL,
  `last_child_id` int(11) DEFAULT NULL,
  `tree_path` longtext NOT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (`comment_ptr_id`),
  KEY `threadedcomments_comment_tree_path` (`tree_path`(255)),
  KEY `threadedcomments_comment_63f17a16` (`parent_id`),
  KEY `threadedcomments_comment_ffd563a7` (`last_child_id`)
)




=====
The rest of the instructions work like standard Django.  See:
 http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.1/
 for more details.

4. Sync the database
   ./manage.py syncdb
   ./manage.py migrate # to complete the south migration setup

5. Run locally (during development)
  ./manage.py runserver myhost.example.com:8000

6. For deployment to Apache, see our sample configuration in apache/prod.conf
   This directory also contains standard django.wsgi file which can be used 
   with other webservers

====
Go to your site in a web browser.
====

7. The default database is not very useful.  Login with the superuser you
   created in Step #4.

8. Click the 'Create a Course' link.
   - Click the "+" to make a group.  Name it something like "test_course"
   - Click the "+" to make a faculty group.  Name it something like "test_course_faculty"
   - In the "Add users to group" field...
     = add yourself as a faculty member by putting your username with a "*" in front
       like this "*admin"
     = add some fellow faculty/student accounts -- you can create new accounts right here
       (read the instructions under the textarea)
     = Click "Save" and then click the upper-right link "Django administration" to get back to the regular site (yeah, not the most intuitive).

9. Experiment with saving assets by visiting:
   http://myhost.example.com:8000/save/

10. For deployment, take a look at the apache/ directory for sample apache configuration files
