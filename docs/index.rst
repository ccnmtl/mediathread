Welcome to Mediathread's developer documentation!
=================================================

Mediathread is Columbia University CTL's innovative, open source
platform for exploration, analysis, and organization of web-based
multimedia content. Mediathread connects to a variety of image and
video collections (such as YouTube, Flickr, library databases, and
course libraries), enabling users to lift items out of these
collections and into an analysis environment. In Mediathread, items
can then be clipped, annotated, organized, and embedded into essays
and other written analysis.

Work in Mediathread can be shared with classmates or larger audiences,
requiring students to formalize thinking, clarify interpretations, and
improve arguments with evidence. A customized home page helps students
track work being done by their classmates on shared items and
projects. Instructors may also publish announcements, assignments, and
model projects to the home page.

Mediathread is a Django application for multimedia annotations
facilitating collaboration on video and image analysis, developed at
the Columbia University Center for Teaching and Learning.

This site documents specific features and technical details of
Mediathread_. There's additional info in our GitHub wiki:
