    <strong>About Course Vocabularies</strong>    
    <div class="feature-help-instructions">A Mediathread course vocabulary is a set of concepts and associated terms chosen by a course instructor. 
    This is a good way to designate metadata for students to apply to items they analyze in Mediathread.</div>
    <br />
    <strong>Creating a Vocabulary</strong>
    <div class="feature-help-instructions">
    <div>A course vocabulary is made up of up to three concepts and an unlimited number of associated terms.</div><br />
    <div>A concept is a category or theme that you will connect with associated terms. Example: "Religion"</div><br />
    <div>A term is a subset or component of a concept. Example: A "Religion" concept might have associated terms like "Buddhism", "Hindusim", "Sikhism", etc.</div><br />
    </div>
    <strong>Editing a Vocabulary</strong>
    <div class="feature-help-instructions">After concepts and their associated terms are created, their names can be updated by instructors. 
    To edit a name, click the pencil item, type in the updated name, and then click the check box to save. 
    If an item in Mediathread has been associated with an term that is subsequently updated, that updated term will apply to the Item.</div>
    <br />
    <strong>Deleting a Concept or Term</strong>
    <div class="feature-help-instructions">Instructors may delete concepts and terms by clicking on the trash icon. If a term is deleted, all of its 
    associations with Items in Mediathread are also deleted and cannot be restored. If a concept is deleted, 
    all of its associated terms are also deleted and cannot be restored.</div>
