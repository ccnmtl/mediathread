# Courses & Assignments

Mediathread organizes all activity within **Courses**. A Course contains members (Instructors, Students), Assets, and Assignments.

## For Instructors

### Creating a Course
Courses are typically created by administrators or via LTI integration. Once a course exists, you can manage it:
1.  Navigate to the **Course Settings** tab.
2.  Manage the **Roster** to add or remove students manually (if not using LTI).

### Assignments
Instructors can create several types of assignments:

*   **Selection Assignment:** Students must identify and annotate specific parts of an asset.
*   **Sequence Assignment:** Students order assets or selections into a narrative sequence.

To create an assignment:
1.  Go to the **Assignments** tab.
2.  Click **Create Assignment**.
3.  Choose the type and set the due date and instructions.
