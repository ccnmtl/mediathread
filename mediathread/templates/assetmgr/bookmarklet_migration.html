            It looks like you've run into a bookmarklet error caused by
            either the website you were on, or your web browser. This
            happened because there's a
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_Security_Policy"
               >new web security standard</a> that doesn't work well with
            bookmarklets.
        </p>

        <p>
            Here are two different ways you can get around this limitation:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Try another web browser. If you're using Google Chrome,
                    try Firefox or Safari.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Use Mediathread's browser extension to collect
                    media instead of the bookmarklet. The Mediathread
                    extension is available for Chrome, Safari, and
                    Firefox. You can install it using the buttons
                    below.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>
