# User Guide Introduction

Mediathread is designed to help you build arguments and analysis around multimedia objects. Whether you are an instructor creating assignments or a student completing them, the workflow centers on **Assets** and **Selections**.

## Core Concepts

### Assets
An **Asset** is any media item (Video, Audio, Image) brought into Mediathread. Assets can be:
*   Uploaded directly to Mediathread.
*   Imported from external sites via the [Browser Extension](extensions.md).
*   Shared across a Course.

### Selections
A **Selection** is a specific piece of an Asset.
*   **For Video/Audio:** A time range (e.g., "0:10 to 0:45").
*   **For Images:** A cropped rectangular region.

You "annotate" by creating a Selection and adding text to it. These Selections can then be embedded into Compositions or Discussions.

### Compositions
A **Composition** is a multimedia essay. Instead of just writing text, you embed your Selections directly into the document. This allows readers to click a Selection and immediately see/hear the evidence you are citing.
