These are the compiled PDF.js files (https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js).

When you upgrade this library, after compiling with `gulp generic`,
there are a few hardcoded variables you need to update.

* viewer.js: Update defaultUrl to window.ASSET_URL.
* viewer.js: Update HOSTED_VIEWER_ORIGINS to: [
        "null",
        "https://ctl-mediathread-private-prod.s3.amazonaws.com",
        "https://ctl-mediathread-private-dev.s3.amazonaws.com",
        "https://mediathread.ctl.columbia.edu",
        "https://mediathread.stage.ctl.columbia.edu",
        "https://maldive.ccnmtl.columbia.edu"
    ];

* pdf.js: You need to set workerSrc to window.WORKER_SRC.
