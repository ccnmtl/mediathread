                               A Mediathread course vocabulary is a set of concepts and associated terms chosen by a course instructor.
                               This is a good way to designate metadata for students to apply to items they analyze in Mediathread.

                               A course vocabulary is made up of up to three concepts and an unlimited number of associated terms.
                               A concept is a category or theme that you will connect with associated terms. Example: "Religion"
                               A term is a subset or component of a concept. Example: A "Religion" concept might have associated terms like "Buddhism", "Hindusim", "Sikhism", etc.
